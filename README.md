## About the Site

This site was built for a real band, Amarillo Sky, based in Elkhart, IN. It was made for my final project within the General Assembly and created using React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. The HTML and CSS were also all built by scratch for this website by [Kyle Meserve](https://kylemeserve.com/).

The assignment required that I teach myself something we hadn't covered in class and I used moment.js to work with the events in my database and make the Date object in JavaScript easier to work with. It was used on both the home page and on the events page.

---

## Provided Service

This app allows users to learn about the band, see their set list(s) and upcoming events. In addition, it provides easy ways to contact the band and book an event and links to their social-media sites.

It will be updated regularly with event times and new pictures and the final product will allow the band manager to log in and update the events without any help from the web developer. Regular users will not be able to log in.

## Remaining Bugs/Issues

The site is not styled for the mobile yet. This will be done by December 14th, 2018 for the clients, but is not done by the 30th of November.

The events currently do not list in the correct direction for Upcoming Events on the events page. Again, this will be done by the 14th of December, 2018.

The image carousel on the home page changes sizes slightly depending on the picture being shown. This will be fixed by the 14th of December, 2018, as well.

If you find any other bugs with the site, please send me an email at meserve.kyle@gmail.com.
